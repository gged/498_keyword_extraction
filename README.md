# 498_keyword_extraction

## Things to do
* Implement SVM code - train_svm, test_svm (can call it whatever you want, see end of run.py for how I used it)
* Implement feature extraction - right now only the gram extraction (1-gram, 2-gram, 3-gram) part is done, and we still need to get the features from these (entropy distributions, max length, etc.)
* Fix graph method code to work with this preprocessing and dataset format
* Fix is_keyword in run.py so it changes the labels of the feature vector depending on whether the keyword is in the answer keywords
* Lots of other random comments I added in the code to add/fix
* Other things
